Syncing functions for GTA Connected.

Due to the nature of how GTA Connected works, most of the scripting functions (and properties) that scripters are accustomed to don't exist server-side.

Fortunately for scripters, GTA Connected provides abilities to add network handlers, allowing custom callbacks to help sync things.
So, this project is to provide scripters with a foundation to use functions they are familiar with, both server and client side.
